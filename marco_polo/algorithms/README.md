# Algorithms

This directory manages the specific implementations used in Marco Polo. The idea 
is to leverage encapsulation so that we always have the functions we need while 
having the freedom to change the implementations.

There are two algorithms included - the POET algorithm () and a algorithm that per

* `poet.py` - The ePOET algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08536).
* `evolutiontemplate.py` - A example template of the evolution class that performs simple sequential parameter sampling.
